# Binary Search Trees

## General Information

-   The project is a part of The Odin Project: Full Stack JavaScript
-   A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree in which each node has a key/value pair, and the keys in the left subtree are less than the key in the current node, while the keys in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the key in the current node

## Description

### Tree Class

-   The Tree class represents the Binary Search Tree as a whole. It is responsible for managing the nodes and performing various operations on the tree

#### Methods

-   **buildTree(arr)**: takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed
-   **insertRec(root, key)**: Inserts a new node with the specified key into the tree, following the rules of a Binary Search Tree
-   **deleteRec(root, key)**: Removes a node with the specified key from the tree, maintaining the Binary Search Tree properties
-   **find(value, root)**: Accepts a value and returns the node with the given value.
-   **levelOrder()**: A method that traverse the tree in breadth-first level order
-   **preOrder()**: A type of tree traversal that visits the root node first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree
-   **inOrder()**: An inorder traversal first visits the left child (including its entire subtree), then visits the node, and finally visits the right child (including its entire subtree)
-   **postOrder()**: In this traversal method, the root node is visited last, hence the name. First we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node
-   **height()**: Height is defined as the number of edges in longest path from a given node to a leaf node.
-   **depth()**: Depth is defined as the number of edges in path from a given node to the tree’s root node.
-   **isBalanced()**: Checks if the tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree of every node is not more than 1.
-   **reBalanced()**: Rebalances an unbalanced tree

### Node Class

-   The Node class represents a single node in a Binary Search Tree.
-   **data**: The key or value associated with the node.
-   **left**: A reference to the left child node.
-   **right**: A reference to the right child node.

## Usage

To run the script, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer.

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps to run the implementations:

1. Save or git clone this repo
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repo directory
3. Change & modify the script.
4. Run script

    ```
    node script.js

    ```

5. The output will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.
